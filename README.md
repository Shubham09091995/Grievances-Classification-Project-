# NLP Grievances Classification Project
This project implements Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify grievances based on textual complaint data.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
Organizations receive numerous complaints daily. Automating their classification using NLP can enhance response efficiency. This project builds a text classification model to predict grievance categories.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview
- Large grievance dataset with complaint texts and metadata
- Sampling applied for optimized model training

## ðŸ”§ Preprocessing Steps
- **Text Cleaning:** Lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal, lemmatization
- **Feature Engineering:** TF-IDF vectorization for text representation

## ðŸ¤– Model Development
The project implements multiple machine learning models:
- Logistic Regression
- NaÃ¯ve Bayes
- Random Forest
Evaluation metrics include:
- **Accuracy**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Classification Report**

## ðŸŽ¯ Results & Conclusion
- Successful classification of grievances using NLP
- Scalable approach for automating grievance handling in industries like **customer support, telecom, and insurance**
